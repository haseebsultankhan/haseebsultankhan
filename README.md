## Hello, I'm Haseeb SultanðŸ‘‹

### About Me
Highly motivated Data Scientist with a Master's in Systems Engineering, currently holding the position of Assistant Director of Data Analytics at NADRA Pakistan. I specialize in machine learning, particularly Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), Data Analytics, Deep Learning, and Cloud Engineering for deploying solutions on AWS and Azure. Certified by IBM and NVIDIA in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, Data Analytics, and Microsoft Security.

My experience encompasses working with diverse domains, including health monitoring, data-driven decision making in banking, image/audio processing and manipulation, and data extraction from large, complex datasets.

### Expertise
- Generative AI: Successfully deployed large language models (LLMs) like LLAMA-3 and Gemma 12-B on a local network (LAN), making them accessible to everyone within the network.
- Data Analytics: Skilled at transforming complex datasets into actionable insights, driving informed decision-making.
- Machine Learning: Possess extensive knowledge in neural networks, deep learning, and algorithm optimization techniques.
- Project Highlights:
  - Health Monitoring: Leveraged neural networks to classify 12-lead ECG signals, potentially aiding in early disease detection.
  - Data Driven Banking: Utilized data analytics to extract valuable insights for informed banking decisions.
  - Image Processing: Successfully deployed and fine-tuned Stable Diffusion for creative content generation and deep fake detection across various media formats.

### Tools and Technologies
- Languages: Python
- Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Keras, FastAPI, Flask, Django, Streamlit
- Tools: Postman, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub
- Cloud Platforms: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure

### Current Projects
- Automated Attendance System: Developed a real-time face detection system that integrates with a database for efficient attendance marking.
- Gender Verification System: Implemented a deep learning-based solution to identify gender and flag potential discrepancies with database entries.
- Intelligent Document Processing System: An OCR system that recognizes and extracts data from various identification documents like national IDs, passports, and driver's licenses.
